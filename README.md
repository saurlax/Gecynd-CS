# Project2398
I hope it will become a more sophisticated voxel sandbox game that supports mods. Exquisite simulation of all things on earth, allowing players to create and share freely more naturally.

## Logs
2022/7/25: I repeatedly switched the project from C# and C++, OpenGL and Vulkan, and finally chose back to C# and OpenGL. I understand that I don't have the ability to deal with C++ and Vulkan, and I don't have the technology to achieve their high efficiency.

## Dotnet Scripts
Some dotnet commands, let me know what I should do.

* dotnet restore
* dotnet run
* dotnet publish
